          <h2>Prework</h2>
          <p>Before starting class we were given four weeks of work to do just to make sure we all entered into class with a little foundation. The prework wasn't too challenging, and I enjoyed getting a small insight into what class would be like. The topics that were covered included HTML CSS and some javascript. I have some experience with these so I never really ran into any challenges completing the projects.
          I am excited to begin learning full time, and can't wat to see how far I go in the the twelve weeks.

          <h2>Week One</h2>
          <p>This first week was a little overwhelming. I was excited to finally be in class and see what kind of magic
            they were going to do to turn me into a developer. I was relieved to find out that most of the students were
            beginners as well. This gave me a sense of relief because I was really concerned I would be the only one
            without some kind of coding background.

            We started the first day off with javascript warm up’s. It was a little daunting and caused me to doubt
            myself very early in the morning. I was discouraged but found it a little comforting that I seemed not to be
            the only one confused. Fortunately our warm up coach and teachers were there to explain, answer any
            questions we had and walk us though solving the problem. With their help I felt more comfortable and
            confident with continuing on the rest of the class.
            Over the rest of the week we learned a lot about writing HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. We made a campaign website
            for our first project. I enjoyed using Bootstrap and CSS to design my page. That’s really what interested me
            in coding in the first place. I enjoy watching a blank webpage become something great.

          <h2>Week Two</h2>
          <p>I felt way more confident starting this week. The first warmups of the week were tough, but I felt like I
            knew how to approach them, and a couple of them I even solved.

            My confidence quickly faded when we were tasked with creating a tic tac toe gam and calculator. My first
            instinct was to google “how to . . . . “ but I wanted to “jump off the cliff,” and build them up from
            scratch. IT. WAS. A. MISTAKE. Just kidding. I was happy I got the experience of writing down what I needed
            and finding the JS methods to make them functional. The downside of it was I became overwhelmed many times
            while completing the exercises. I also feel like I fell behind this week because I was determined to build
            them myself but it took me way more time than anticipated.
            Overall this week was great. I am enjoying my Time in camp, and I am really excited to see what come in the
            next week.

          <h2>Week Three</h2>
          <p> I started off this week feeling pretty overwhelmed. I am still playing catchup with my exercises but I'm
            slowly but surely getting it together.
            We started learning Vue this week. I was really excited to dive into it because we were told it would make
            javascript easier(THANK GOD). Im hoping the "easier" part comes soon because I'm not really seeing it. Our
            Vue project is to make a ToDo list. I'm trying to make it as simple as I can, getting caught up on design
            has been by downfall lately. I have to remember that I can always go back and fix things later.
            I am excited and feel like we're really picking up momentum. Two weeks ago I wasnt sure I could be a
            developer and now i feel like im almost there.

          <p>This week we worked on our group project.  I was a little aprehensive about working with a group because I am more introverted and I sometimes have a hard time speaking up in group settings. This proved not to be a problem though. Everone in the group contributed and listened to each others input.
